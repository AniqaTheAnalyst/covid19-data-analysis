# COVID-19 Data Analysis & Interactive Dashboard

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes global COVID-19 data using SQL for data exploration and Tableau for visualization.  
The goal of this project is to explore infection trends, calculate the percentage of population infected, and identify peak infection periods across selected countries.

## 📊 Dataset
**Source:** Our World in Data – COVID-19 Dataset  
🔗 https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths  

The dataset includes:
- Confirmed cases
- Confirmed deaths
- Population data
- Date-wise country-level records

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies Used
- MySQL (Data Cleaning & Analysis)
- Tableau (Dashboard & Visualization)
- Excel (Initial Data Handling)
- GitHub (Project Documentation)

---

## 🧮 SQL Analysis Performed
- Calculated total cases and deaths by country
- Identified highest infection count per country
- Computed percentage of population infected
- Analyzed trends over time
- Compared infection rates across countries

---

## 📈 Tableau Dashboard
The dashboard visualizes:
- Infection trends over time (2020–2026)
- Country-wise comparison
- Peak infection percentages
- Cumulative infection growth patterns

The visualization highlights how different countries experienced varying infection growth and stabilization periods.


---

## 🔍 Key Insights
- Some countries reached infection rates above 40% of total population.
- Infection growth accelerated significantly between 2021–2022.
- Several countries plateaued after reaching peak cumulative infection levels.
- Developing countries showed comparatively lower infection percentages.
